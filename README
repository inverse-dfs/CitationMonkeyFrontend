This repository holds the code needed for the front end of our full stack application.

You need to have npm installed to run this app.

1. Clone this repo 
2. cd ./CitationMonkeyFrontend/citationmonkey/
3. run 'npm i' to install all needed packages
4. run 'npm start' to start the web app locally, it should open up in your browser and run on localhost 3000

We will move this fully to the cloud, however for now it is a local web app. Though the database it interacts with is in the cloud.
